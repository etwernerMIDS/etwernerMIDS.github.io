Hi, I am Erin Werner. I am originally from Southern California and currently live in New York City.

*I am an independent and self-motivated Software Engineer and Data Science graduate student with proven and tested programming, analysis, and research skills. I am proficient in Python, R, Java, C, Tableau, and SQL with a working knowledge of Hadoop and Spark.*

I have always had a passion for data science and am very enthusiastic about improving buisness operations through the means of data analysis and would welcome any opportunity to contribute my skills. 

I am currently working towards my masterâ€™s in data science at the University of California, Berkeley. This program is expanding my interdisciplinary skill set while challenging me to think about the greater social impact of my data science project design. I am balancing my school work while working as a software engineer with a specialization in data migrations and reports.

While completing my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of California - San Diego, I worked at the Center for Peace and Security Studies, a think tank that uses data analytics and programming to support their global policy research. This position gave me experience with working on a team in order to take on complex problems. I also had an internship in which I was a Nuclear Data Analyst for the Department of Homeland Security at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. There, I conducted my own machine learning project in which I helped to improve nuclear material detection capabilities in vehicle cargo.

Additionally, I have been able to:
* Utilize multiple different coding languages, such as Python, R, and SQL.
* Create and present posters/presentations to effectively communicate my work.
* Consult with my client about their needs and deliver the solutions.

Due to my work experience, I enjoy applying my technical skills in ways that have real world impacts. My resume and contact information are on the other tabs. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss potential oportunities in detail.
